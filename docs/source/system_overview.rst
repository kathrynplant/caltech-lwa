F-Engine System Overview
========================

Overview
--------

The LWA352 F-Engine firmware is designed to run on a SNAP2 [1]_ FPGA board, and provides channelization of 64 analog data streams, sampled at up to 200 Msps, into 4096 sub-bands.

After channelization, data words are requantized to 4-bit resolution (4-bit real + 4-bit imaginary) and a subset of the 4096 generated frequency channels are output as a UDP/IP stream over a single 40 Gb/s Ethernet interface.

The top-level specs of the F-Engine are:

Initialization
++++++++++++++

The functionality of individual blocks is described below.
However, in order to simply get the firmware into a basic working state the following process should be followed:

  1. Program the FPGA
  2. Initialize all blocks in the system
  3. Trigger master reset and timing synchronization event.

In a multi-board system, the process of synchronizing a board can be relatively involved.
For testing purposes, using single board, a simple software reset can be used in place of a hardware timing signal to perform an artificial synchronization.
A software reset is automatically issued as part of system initialization.

The following commands bring the F-engine firmware into a functional state, suitable for testing.
See :numref:`control-interface` for a full software API description

.. code-block:: python

  # Import the SNAP2 F-Engine library
  from lwa_f import snap2_fengine

  # Instantiate a Snap2Fengine instance to a board with
  # hostname 'snap2-rev2-11'
  f = snap2_fengine.Snap2Fengine('snap2-rev2-11')

  # Program a board
  f.program() # Load whatever firmware is in flash
  # Wait 30 seconds for the board to reboot...

  # Initialize all the firmware blocks
  # and issue a global software reset
  f.initialize(read_only=False)


Block Descriptions
++++++++++++++++++

Each block in the firmware design can be controlled using an API described in :numref:`control-interface`. Here the basic functionality of each block is described.

ADC
~~~

The ADC block contains the interface to the physical ADC cards, and presents ADC data to the Simulink DSP pipeline. It is controlled using the API in :numref:`control-adc`. This API provides the ability to read ADC samples, and is required to "train" the ADC to FPGA link after the FPGA is programmed.

The block has the following ports:

Output Data Format
==================

UDP packets output from the F-Engine are described below.
Packet format is chosen to be broadly compatible with ``bifrost``'s
packet receive architecture, and to have the following features:

  - Supports arbitrary numbers of channels / antenna inputs per packet
  - Allows channels to be easily distributed among multiple destinations
    (X-Engine pipelines)

.. code:: C

    struct f_packet {
            uint64_t  seq;
            uint32_t  sync_time;
            uint16_t  nsignal;
            uint16_t  nsignal_tot;
            uint16_t  nchan;
            uint16_t  nchan_tot;
            uint32_t  chan_block_id;
            uint32_t  chan0;
            uint32_t  signal0;
            uint8_t   data[nchan, nsignal];
    };

Packet Fields are as follows:

Packet parameters are chosen to be compatible with the total number
of frequencies the system is required to process, the number of
independent X-Engine pipelines in the system, a target packet size
(generally larger is better, up to the Ethernet network's largest
allowed *Maximum Transmission Unit* (MTU).

In practice, the LWA352 system operates with
  - ``nsignal = 64``
  - ``nsignal_tot = 704``
  - ``nchan = 96``
  - ``nchan_tot = 192``
