Control Interface
=================

Overview
--------

A Python class ``Snap2Fengine`` is provided to encapsulate control
of individual blocks in the firmware DSP pipeline.
The structure of the software interface aims to mirror the hierarchy of
the firmware modules, through the use of multiple ``Block`` class instances,
each of which encapsulates control of a single module in the firmware pipeline.

In testing, and interactive debugging, the ``Snap2Fengine`` class provides
an easy way to probe board status for a SNAP2 board on the local network.

In order to integrate with the larger LWA352 control framework,
control and monitoring of multiple F-Engines can also be carried out through
the passing of JSON-encoded messages through an ``etcd``\  [1]_
key-value store.
This mechanismi, shown in :numref:`control_top`,
utilizes the Python class ``Snap2FengineEtcdClient`` to
translate commands and responses between the ``etcd`` format and the
underlying ``Snap2Fengine`` method calls.

    The top-level control architecture. 


``Snap2Fengine`` Python Interface
---------------------------------

The ``Snap2Fengine`` class can be instantiated and used to control
a single SNAP2 board running LWA's F-Engine firmware. An example is below:


.. code-block:: python

  # Import the SNAP2 F-Engine library
  from lwa_f import snap2_fengine

  # Instantiate a Snap2Fengine instance to a board with
  # hostname 'snap2-rev2-11'
  f = snap2_fengine.Snap2Fengine('snap2-rev2-11')

  # Program a board (if it is not already programmed)
  # and initialize all the firmware blocks
  if not f.fpga.is_programmed():
    f.program() # Load whatever firmware is in flash
    # Wait 30 seconds for the board to reboot...
    # Initialize firmware blocks, including ADC link training
    f.initialize(read_only=False)

  # Blocks are available as items in the Snap2Fengine `blocks`
  # dictionary, or can be accessed directly as attributes
  # of the Snap2Fengine.

  # Print available block names
  print(sorted(f.blocks.keys()))
  # Returns:
  # ['adc', 'autocorr', 'corr', 'delay', 'eq', 'eq_tvg', 'eth',
  # 'fpga', 'input', 'noise', 'packetizer', 'pfb', 'reorder', 'sync']

  # Grab some ADC data from the ADC card(s) on FMC 1
  adc_data = f.adc.get_snapshot_interleaved(1, signed=True)
  print(adc_data.shape) # returns (32 [channels], 512 [time samples]

Details of the methods provided by individual blocks are given in the next
section.


Top-Level Control
+++++++++++++++++

The Top-level ``Snap2Fengine`` instance can be used to perform high-level
control of the firmware, such as programming and de-programming FPGA boards.
It can also be used to apply configurations which affect multiple firmware
subsystems, such as configuring channel selection and packet destination.

Finally, a ``Snap2Fengine`` instance can be used to initialize, or get status
from, all underlying firmware modules.

``etcd`` Interface
------------------

The ``etcd`` F-Engine interface provides a mechanism to control multiple
SNAP2 boards running F-Engine firmware via the passing of messages through
an ``etcd`` key-value store.

In order to use the ``etcd`` control interface, a daemon
``Snap2FengineEtcdClient`` instance is required to be running on
a server with network access to the SNAP2 hardware being controlled.

Key Organization
++++++++++++++++

For an F-Engine running on a SNAP2 ``hostname``, there are three relevant
``etcd`` key paths.

Command
^^^^^^^

The command key is:

``/cmd/snap/<id>``

``id`` is the one-indexed ID number of the SNAP board which should respond
to these commands. Commands issues to ``id=0`` are processed by all SNAP boards.

Writing messages to this key results in the execution of ``Snap2Fengine``
command methods.

Response
^^^^^^^^

Each command written to the command key will elicit a response published
to the key:

``/resp/snap/<id>``

The response message will indicate the success of failure of the command,
and may contain a command-dependent data payload. For example, a spectra, or
snapshot of ADC samples.

Monitor
^^^^^^^

In addition to the command/response interface described above, a set of basic status values
are continuously-polled and written to etcd. This allows basic monitoring scripts to simply
watch the etcd keystore to determine system health, rather than having to issue commands.

Each SNAP board reports monitor information to the key:

``/mon/snap/<id>``

The monitor key is indended to be continuously updated on a ~1 second time cadence,
and contains low data-volume status information. For example, FPGA temperature,
ADC RMS, number of transmitted Ethernet packets, and similar.


Command/Response Protocol
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Command/Response protocol is designed to be a simple interface to the
underlying ``Snap2Fengine`` control class.
It will naturally extend as the control class functionality is expanded.

A simple example of a control client is implemented in the
``Snap2FengineEtcdControl`` class, which is used for internal testing.

Command Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commands sent to the command key are JSON-encoded dictionaries, and should
have the following fields:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Type
      - Description

    * - id
      - string
      - A unique string associated with this   
        command, used to identify the command's
        response

    * - cmd
      - string
      - Command name

    * - val
      - dictionary
      - A dictionary containing keys:
          - time (string) The time these statistics were gathered, in ISO 3339 format.
          - block (string): The firmware block name to which this command applies.
          - kwargs (dictionary): Dictionary of arguments required by the ``block.command`` method.

Allowed values for **``block``** are any of the keys in the ``Snap2Fengine``
blocks attribute. I.e.:

.. code-block:: python

  from lwa_f import snap2_fengine
  f = snap2_fengine.Snap2Fengine('snap2-rev2-11')
  for block in sorted(f.blocks.keys()): print(block)
  adc
  autocorr
  corr
  delay
  eq
  eqtvg
  eth
  fpga
  input
  noise
  packetizer
  pfb
  powermon
  reorder
  sync

Additionally, the block name ``feng`` may be used to refer to the ``Snap2Fengine``
instance, and the block name ``controller`` may be used to refer to special
commands associated with the ``etcd`` service process.

Allowed values for **``cmd``** are any of the methods which can be called
against ``Snap2Fengine.blocks[block]``.
For example, for the ``delay`` block, allowed commands are:

  - ``get_max_delay``
  - ``set_delay``
  - ``get_delay``
  - ``initialize``
  - ``get_status``

All blocks are instances of the generic ``Block`` class, and thus it is also
possible to call parent class methods such as ``read_uint`` and ``write_uint``.
These directly manipulate FPGA registers, and should be used with caution.

The **``kwargs``** field should contain any arguments required by the command
method being called.
For example, the Fengine ``delay`` block's ``set_delay`` method requires
a ``stream`` argument (to select which of the 64 SNAP2 data streams is being
manipulated) and a ``delay`` argument (to set the delay for this stream).

As such, in order to set the delay of data stream ``5`` to ``100`` adc samples,
a command should be issued with:

  +--------------+-------------------------------------+
  | Field        | Value                               |
  +==============+=====================================+
  | ``cmd``      | ``"set_delay"``                     |
  +--------------+-------------------------------------+
  | ``val``      | ``{block: "delay", kwargs:          |
  |              | {"stream": 5, "delay": 100}``       |
  +--------------+-------------------------------------+

An example of a valid command JSON string, issued with the above parameters
at UNIX time 1618060712.60 and with ``id="1"`` is:

``'{"cmd": "set_delay", "val": {"block": "delay", "timestamp": 1618060712.6, "kwargs": {"stream": 5, "delay": 100}}, "id": "1"}'``

Consult the ``Snap2Fengine`` API details for a list of commands and their arguments.


Response Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every command sent elicits the writing of JSON-encoded dictionary to the
response key.
This dictionary has the following fields:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Type
      - Description

    * - id
      - string
      - A string matching the ``id`` field of
        the command string to which this is a
        response

    * - val
      - dictionary
      - A dictionary containing keys:
          - timestamp (float) The UNIX time when this response was issued.
          - status (string): The string "normal" if the corresponding command was processed without error,
            or "error" if it was not.
          - response (dictionary): The response of the command method, as
            determined by the command API. If a method would usually return a numpy
            array, when using the ``etcd`` interface the response will be a list.
            In the event that the status field is ``"error"``, The response field will
            contain an error message string.

Not all ``Snap2Fengine`` methods return values, in whice case the response
field is ``null``.
The previous command example (setting a delay) results in the underlying API call
``Snap2Fengine.blocks['delay'].set_delay(5,100)`` which returns ``None``.
The response to the example command (assuming processing the command took
0.2 milliseconds) is thus:

  +-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Field           | Value                                                           |
  +=================+=================================================================+
  | ``id``          | ``"1"``                                                         |
  +-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | ``val``         | ``{timestamp: 1618060712.8, status: "normal", response: null}`` |
  +-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

or, in JSON-encoded form:

``'{"id": "1", "val": {"timestamp": 1618060712.8, "status": "normal", "response": null}}'``

If the response ``status`` field is "error", common ``response`` error messages,
and their meanings are:

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "JSON decode error"         | Command string could not be JSON-decoded.    |
+=============================+==============================================+
| "Sequence ID not string"    | Sequence ID was not provided in the command  |
|                             | string or decoded to a non-string value.     |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "Bad command format"        | Received command did not comply with         |
|                             | formatting specifications. E.g. was missing  |
|                             | a required field such as ``block`` or        |
|                             | ``cmd``.                                     |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "Command invalid"           | Received command doesn't exist in the        |
|                             | ``Snap2Fengine`` API, or is prohibited for   |
|                             | ``etcd`` access.                             |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "Wrong block"               | ``block`` field of the command decoded to a  |
|                             | block which doesn't exist.                   |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "Command arguments invalid" | ``kwargs`` key contained missing, or         |
|                             | unexpected keys.                             |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "Command failed"            | The underlying ``Snap2Fengine`` API call     |
|                             | raised an exception.                         |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

In the event that a command fails, more information is available in the
``Snap2FengineEtcdClient`` daemon logs.

Monitoring Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``etcd`` F-engine control service can be commanded to periodically
push status data to monitoring keys using the following commands.

.. autoclass:: lwa_f.snap2_feng_etcd_client.Snap2FengineEtcdClient
  :no-show-inheritance:
  :members:

These should be invoked similarly to commands against firmware
blocks, but use the ``block`` name ``controller``.

For example, to turn the monitoring poll loop on for 1 hour, with a polling
interval of 30 seconds, issue the command:

  +--------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | Field        | Value                                      |
  +==============+============================================+
  | ``cmd``      | ``"start_poll_stats_loop"``                |
  +--------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | ``val``      | ``{block: "controller", kwargs:            |
  |              | {"pollsecs": 30, "expiresecs": 3600}``     |
  +--------------+--------------------------------------------+

The monitor key contains a nested dictionary with the following keys:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 60
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Type
      - Description

    * - timestamp
      - float
      - The UNIX timestamp at which the monitor key was last updated.

    * - stats
      - dictionary
      - A nested dictionary containing status values, keyed first by block name 
        (eg. ``delay``, ``eq`` or ``corr``) and then by status key.

    * - flags
      - dictionary
      - A nested dictionary containing status values, keyed first by block name 
        (eg. ``delay``, ``eq`` or ``corr``) and then by status key. This dictionary
        contains a subset of the keys present in the ``stats`` field.
        Where they exist, a value associated with a key indicates whether the
        corresponding value in the ``stats`` dictionary is out of normal range.
        Values in the flags dictionary are interpretted as in ``error_levels.py``; i.e.:

          - 0: Value is OK
          - 1: Value is different from operational normal
          - 2: Value is outside expected range
          - 3: Value represents an error condition

Entries in the ``stats`` dictionary are shown below
